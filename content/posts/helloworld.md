After dragging my feet about it for quite a while, I've finally decided to start building my personal website.

The first project I'm going to be posting is a way to monitor the weather at my place. Perfect for helping me decide whether or not to brave the elements or wait the rain out before commuting back. Details soon, hopefully!
